# Hi 
Welcome to the world of programming languages. In this repository you will find for (almost) all languages an example of how Hello World can be output. In this README file you will also find some information about the used languages. I hope you have fun browsing through this interesting summary.
If you know another programming language that is not included, feel free to contact me. I will gladly add it to this collection :)
Also please contact me if you discover any mistakes in the code.
